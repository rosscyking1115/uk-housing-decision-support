-- First decision-support mart.
-- Grain: one row per MSOA area_id.
--
-- This profile exposes Land Registry sale context, ONS local-authority rent
-- (with an affordability ratio), an EPC energy-efficiency profile, a police
-- street-crime indicator, planning-constraint / flood-risk flags, and
-- OpenStreetMap amenity/convenience access, plus a null placeholder for
-- door-to-door commute time. That keeps the product honest: no journey-time
-- commute claims are made before that source exists.
