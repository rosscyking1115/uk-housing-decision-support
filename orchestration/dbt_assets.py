"""The dbt transform layer, loaded as Dagster assets.

`@dbt_assets` turns every model in the dbt project into an asset and every dbt
test into an asset check, with dbt's own lineage preserved. Because the
`landreg.transactions` source is remapped onto the warehouse_transactions asset
(see translator.py), the staging models depend directly on the ingestion output
— one continuous graph.
