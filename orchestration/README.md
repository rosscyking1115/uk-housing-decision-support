# Orchestration (Dagster)

Models the MoveIn data refresh as a **Dagster asset graph**, turning a sequence
of hand-run scripts + dbt commands into an explicit, lineage-tracked pipeline
with a **data-quality gate at ingestion**.

```
raw_landreg_ppd ──► warehouse_transactions ─┐
   (download)          (load to DuckDB)     │
      └─ gate: raw_landreg_ppd_is_sane      │
                                            ├──► [dbt: staging → int → marts] ──► decision_extract
prepared_geography ──► warehouse_geography ─┤      (29 models, 197 tests,           (slim API extract)
prepared_crime ──────► warehouse_crime ─────┤       built with real-source vars)
prepared_epc ────────► warehouse_epc ───────┤
prepared_amenities ──► warehouse_amenities ─┤
prepared_constraints ► warehouse_constraints┘
      └─ each: gate prepared_file_is_sane (pre-load)
```

All **six sources** are wired. The Land Registry spine is fully automated
(download → load). The five reference sources are loaded from prepared files in
`data/raw/`; the prepared files themselves are **external assets** — they come
out of `scripts/prepare_*.py` run against large/licensed archives (police bulk
zip, EPC bulk zip, ONSPD zip, OSM extract, planning CSVs) that are fetched
manually and never committed. Dagster documents that boundary in the lineage
instead of pretending to own it.

## Real sources vs fixture seeds

The staging models switch on dbt vars between the committed fixture seeds
(CI default) and the real `raw_*` warehouse schemas. The orchestrated pipeline
IS the real refresh, so it parses **and** builds with the real-source vars
(`resources.REAL_SOURCE_VARS`): `geo_source: onspd`, `epc_source: bulk`,
`crime_source: bulk`, `constraints_source: computed`, `amenities_source:
computed`. This matters at *parse* time, not just build time — a fixture-vars
manifest would wire staging to the seeds and leave the ingestion assets
disconnected from the graph. Plain `dbt build` (CI) keeps the fixture default.

## Why Dagster (and why not more)

- **Dagster, not Airflow** — the pipeline is a set of data assets with lineage,
  not a task DAG. `dagster-dbt` loads every dbt model as an asset and every dbt
  test as an asset check, so dbt's lineage flows into one graph.
- **DuckDB stays** — the data (4.99M Land Registry rows, 2021–2025) fits on one
  machine. No Snowflake/Spark; that would be cost and ops for no gain.
- **The genuinely new layer is the ingestion gate.** dbt tests run *after* load;
  the gates run *before*. `raw_landreg_ppd_is_sane` validates the raw parquet
  (row-count floor, null flood, malformed-postcode rate) before it enters the
  warehouse. Each reference source carries `prepared_file_is_sane` (row floor,
  required columns, key non-null) evaluated **before the drop-and-recreate
  load** — the loaders replace their table wholesale, so without the gate a
  truncated prepared file would destroy a good table. A failed gate halts the
  graph.
- **Freshness is declared, honestly.** `warehouse_transactions` and
  `decision_extract` carry a `FreshnessPolicy` (warn 35 days / fail 90 —
  mirroring dbt's source-freshness config), and a monthly `ScheduleDefinition`
  exists for `full_refresh` but ships **switched off**: the reference-source
  archives are fetched manually, so an unattended cron would be theatre. The
  cadence is documented in code; turning it on is one toggle.

## Layout

| File | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `definitions.py` | The `Definitions` — assets, checks, the `full_refresh` job, the (stopped) monthly schedule. |
| `resources.py` | Paths, real-source vars, the `DbtProject`/`DbtCliResource`, `load_script()`. |
| `ingest_assets.py` | `raw_landreg_ppd`, `warehouse_transactions` (the automated Land Registry spine + freshness policy). |
| `reference_assets.py` | The five reference sources: external prepared-file specs + gated `warehouse_*` load assets. |
| `dbt_assets.py` | `@dbt_assets` — the whole dbt project as one asset set, built with real-source vars. |
| `export_assets.py` | `decision_extract` — export the two decision marts to the API extract. |
| `checks.py` | `raw_landreg_ppd_is_sane` — the ingestion gate. |
| `translator.py` | Remaps every dbt source onto its ingestion asset so lineage is continuous. |

## Run it

```bash
# from the repo root, with the project venv active
dagster dev -m orchestration.definitions      # UI at http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

The **`full_refresh` job** (Overview → Jobs) runs the whole pipeline in one
launch — ingest → dbt → extract — with steps serialized (`max_concurrent: 1`)
for the single-writer DuckDB file. Individual assets are also materializable
on demand from the Lineage view. There is deliberately no deployed cron: the
source archives behind the `prepared_*` assets are large/licensed and refreshed
manually, so the refresh runs on demand.

Once `decision_extract` writes `data/decision.duckdb`, committing that file to
`main` triggers the existing deploy half of the refresh
(`.github/workflows/refresh.yml` → Fly + Vercel).

CI guards this package with `tests/test_orchestration.py`: it loads the real
`Definitions` (parsing the dbt manifest with the real-source vars on demand)
and asserts the source-remap lineage, the job coverage, and the registered
gates — so an import error or a broken remap fails the PR instead of surfacing
at the next `dagster dev`.

### Config

`raw_landreg_ppd` takes optional run config:

```yaml
ops:
  raw_landreg_ppd:
    config:
      years: [2024, 2025]   # default: the window in dbt_project.yml
      force_refresh: false  # re-download even if the parquet exists
```

## Notes / gotchas

- **profiles.yml** resolves from `~/.dbt` (dbt's default). Override with
  `DBT_PROFILES_DIR` (e.g. in CI).
- **Windows DuckDB write-lock** — the dbt build runs `--threads 1`, and the
  ingest assets must not run concurrently with each other or with a dbt build;
  materialize them sequentially (the write-lock allows one writer per file).
- **Missing prepared file fails the asset** (deliberately). The `load_*.py`
  scripts no-op with exit 0 when their input is absent so plain-dbt CI is
  unaffected; inside the graph that would be a silent lie, so the asset raises
  with a pointer to the right `prepare_*.py`.
- **Scripts are imported by file path** (`resources.load_script`), not via
  `sys.path` — a path side-effect at import time does not survive into
  Dagster's spawned step workers on Windows.
- **protobuf/grpc pins** — see `requirements.txt`; `grpcio-health-checking>=1.82`
  ships a protobuf-7.x gencode that breaks against dbt's `protobuf<7.0` cap.
